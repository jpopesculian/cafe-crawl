      <p>
        its that time of year again! for the first (and probably the last)
        annual cafe crawl ðŸŽ‰ this years special because, as most of you probably
        know, im moving next week ðŸ˜¥ and im hoping to go out quietly... so, i
        was thinking, because ive probably met most of you beautiful people in
        some way or another over a cup of â˜•, i should go through most of the
        cafes that are near and dear to my heart and enjoy one more
        coffee/beer/spritzer/etc with y'all ðŸ˜˜
      </p>
      <p>
        anyways down to how it works: i got a list of cafes down below ðŸ‘‡ and i
        have a map with my face on it above ðŸ‘†. im going to try to keep to the
        schedule on the list, and as i go around on thursday ill keep the map
        updated. come find me and join me ðŸ¤— grab a cup of coffee for 30
        minutes. join me for the whole day. invite friends, family, lovers,
        enemies, whoever. whatever you want, i just wanna see your lovely faces
        if you have time.
      </p>
